    <p>The goal of this server is to be a place where folks can have fun playing Ark and expereince the full range of gameplay available to those who play this game. Public servers are rife with toxic language and griefing; this server aims to create an environment free of that toxicity. <br /><br /></p>
    <p>In order to create such an environment, rules have been set to allow players to clearly understand what constitutes as good behavior on the server and what does not. Please find the rules below. </p>

    <h2> Events </h2>
    <h4>Boss Fights</h4>
    <p>The server will host periodic fights against the bosses on the map for element, experience, engrams, and fun! If you've missed out on one or it feels like it's been a while, don't hesitate to ask for one. You can bring your own dinos to the fight to see how they fare, or sit back and let some super strong dinos take care of the bosses for you.</p>

    <h4>Trips to other Arks</h4>
    <p>Scorched Earth has many dinos available that aren't avaiable in the tropical maps, including the Wyvern, Rock Elemental, and Mantis. If enough people are on board, we will switch the map to scorched earth for a period of time so that folks can tame creatures and upload them, taking them back to the original Ark.</p>

    <h4>Battles</h4>
    <p>It has been suggested that an arena be constructed for hosting battles. This sounds like a great idea, and </p>

    <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/unce.us/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdALxMndwEjx6W5qlYLbDWUkUSfLPnpd8jObtBm8HmOPZLP-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link">Make a suggestion - share your idea and see the server improve!</a>

    <h2> Rules </h2>
    <p>Please remember that ARK is buggy. New rules are subject to being added or altered if the need arises or if we encounter a new bug with a potential for abuse.</p>

      <p>If you have a complaint against another player or tribe please remember the "Burden of Proof". Unless an admin witnesses the event in question some proof of the claim would be needed. This can be accomplished with screenshots in most cases.</p>

      <h4>Toxic Behavior</h4>
      <p>Verbal or other behavior that is demeaning toward other players is not allowed on the server. This includes any sort of disparaging remark made at another player.</p>

      <h4>Griefing</h4>
      <p>Griefing players is not the same as PvP. If you are preventing a player from playing the game, then you are Griefing. This includes (but is not limited to) a tribe's repeated raids on the same players/tribe, or weak/new tribes, preventing players/tribes from rebuilding, keeping a player locked in a cage for a long period and raiding just to despawn loot. **All Griefing Complaints are handled case-by-case because there is a very fine line between what is considered normal PVP and what is considered Griefing.**</p>

      <h4>White Flag Policy</h4>
      <p><strong>Any players or tribes with a white flag flying above or around their base are exempt from PvP</strong>. This means that they may not be attacked, but that they also may not attack other players. New players (under one week) do not need to announce their adoption of the white flag, however <em>everyone</em> must announce that they are removing their white flag if they should choose to do so. Once the announcement is made, the player or tribe <strong>may not raid for at least 6 hours</strong>.</p>

      <h4>Spawn Blocking</h4>
      <p>Blocking Spawns | Bases that block Popular spawns are subject to being cleared.
an example would be an artifact cave or the volcano on the island map . An example of what this does not include is your personal favorite spot to farm chitin. With the maps being cross cluster there are many rich spots to farm needed resources. Explore!</p>

      <h4>Tribe Bases</h4>
      <p>Each tribe is allowed a maximum of Two bases per server. (Raid Bases excluded)</p>

      <h4>Tribe Cap</h4>
      <p>A Tribe Cap of 6 Members is in place. Tribe cycling to get around this is not alllowed.</p>

      <h4>Tribe Alliances</h4>
      <p>Alliances with other tribes are totally fine, however when raiding only a max of 2 tribes may raid another tribe at one time. This is to prevent large tribes working around the tribe cap (similar to tribe cycling) just to wipe another tribe.</p>

      <p>In the event a Dinosaur is lost it will NOT be replaced by an Admin</p>

      <h4> Rule Violations</h4>
      <p>If a rule is violated, in most circumstances the violator will receive a warning. If the violator breaks another rule, they will be banned.</p>
